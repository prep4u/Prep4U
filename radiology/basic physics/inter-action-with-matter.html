      <h1 style="font-size: 26px;">How X-Rays Interact with the Human Body: A Journey Inside Diagnostic Imaging</h1>
      <p>When an X-ray beam passes through the human body, it doesn't simply travel in a straight line without effect. Instead, it engages in complex interactions with various tissues and materials inside the body. These interactions are fundamental to producing diagnostic images that allow doctors to visualize bones, organs, and abnormalities. But what exactly happens when X-rays enter the body?</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Understanding X-Ray Behavior</h2>
      <p>X-rays are a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with very short wavelengths. When they encounter tissues, several things can happen: they may be absorbed, scattered, or pass through unaffected. The outcome depends on factors such as the X-ray's energy and the composition of the tissue, directly influencing the contrast and clarity of the resulting image.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Photoelectric Effect</h2>
      <p>One of the most important interactions in diagnostic radiology is the photoelectric effect. This occurs when an X-ray photon transfers all its energy to an inner-shell electron, typically in dense tissues like bone. The electron is ejected, and the photon is absorbed. This interaction is more likely in tissues with higher atomic numbers, such as calcium in bones. As a result, bones appear white on X-ray images due to their high absorption of radiation, leaving fewer photons to reach the detector.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Compton Scattering</h2>
      <p>Another key interaction is Compton scattering. Here, an X-ray photon collides with a loosely bound outer-shell electron, losing some energy and changing direction. Both the ejected electron and the scattered photon continue along new paths. This interaction is more common in soft tissues and contributes to image blurring. It also poses a concern for radiation safety, as scattered X-rays can expose nearby tissues or personnel to unwanted radiation.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Coherent Scattering</h2>
      <p>In coherent (or classical) scattering, the X-ray photon interacts with the entire atom but does not lose energy. Instead, it changes direction slightly. Though rare and involving low energy, this interaction still contributes minimally to image fog and has limited diagnostic significance.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Other High-Energy Interactions</h2>
      <p>In high-energy environments, such as radiation therapy, additional interactions like pair production and photodisintegration may occur. These interactions require much higher energies and are not typically encountered in standard medical imaging.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Factors Influencing X-Ray Interactions</h2>
      <p>The extent of interaction depends on the X-ray energy (controlled by kilovoltage) and the material’s density and atomic number. Dense materials with high atomic numbers—such as bone or metal—absorb more X-rays and appear white on the image. Soft tissues absorb fewer X-rays, appearing in varying shades of gray, while air absorbs the least and appears black.</p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, understanding how X-rays interact with matter is essential to the science of radiography. Whether through absorption, scattering, or transmission, these interactions shape the medical images used for diagnosis. By mastering this knowledge, healthcare professionals can optimize imaging techniques for better outcomes while ensuring patient and staff safety. These invisible processes are the foundation behind every clear, meaningful X-ray image seen in clinical practice.</p>
